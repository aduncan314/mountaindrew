        <p>Hi, I am Drew. I am a Boston-based developer who enjoys working with data, databases, APIs, and other hidden
            parts of an application that keep it running.</p>
        <p>For the past two years I wrote python everyday and <a href="https://xkcd.com/2054/">managed data
            pipelines</a> for an ed tech company. Before that, I taught <a href="https://xkcd.com/2117/">AP Calc</a> and
            other math courses at a charter school in Everett. I graduated with a BS in <a
                    href="https://xkcd.com/410/">Math</a> and <a href="https://xkcd.com/1240/">Physics</a> from UMass
            Boston.</p>
        <p>I am using this site to learn more about full-stack development. It’s built with nginx/gunicorn/Django and
            Bootstrap for the front-end to start. I’ll be writing about what I learn on my <a
                    href="{% url 'blog:Blog' %}">blog</a>.</p>
        <p>When I am not programming, I am probably playing bass in my classic rock cover band, playing with synths,
            climbing a rock, or <span data-toggle="tooltip"

    <script>$(function () {
        $('[data-toggle="tooltip"]').tooltip()
    })</script>
